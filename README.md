# Expanded Texture Templates
A pack of templates for MCreator or other paint software, ranging from Vanilla Minecraft to User Generated templates.

-Dump archive contents into this folder.
-If you haven't already, close MCreator and reopen it.

What's the *manual* folder?
This is for textures that you can't make in MCreator due to it's current limitations. You need to use other programs such as paint.net and Gimp to make these textures.
What's the *sounds* folder?
This is a folder that contains many 1.16 sounds for MCreator v2020.5 and below. v2020.6/2021.1 has 1.16 support, and many sounds from 1.16.

Addng custom content:
Just create a folder with your name, and dump your templates in the same format as the Vanilla folder. CHECK TO MAKE SURE THERE ARE NO SIMILAR NAMES AS SOME FILES MIGHT GET OVERWRITTEN WHEN A USER DOWNLOADS THE PACK.
